In the past, when I was talking with those people who are not developers but working with, I tended to use a lot of technical terms.

I had trouble when I was working on LG Smart TV with Business group people. They didn’t understand the technical terms deeply(but seemed to know that) and I thought I explained all the situation easy enough for them but it was not. They complained and I was reprimanded for using difficult words.

I realized that I had needed to be brought down to the not developer’s level. Being self-centered communication leads to a misunderstanding between those who perform different duties. Recurrent misunderstandings brings distrust.

Thus, You should make the words easy enough that he/she can understand. Better communication could bring better performance and products. Now harmonious communicating skill is mandatory as well as technical skills for developers.
