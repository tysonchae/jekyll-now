In order to make better products, I believe that it is necessary to raise the level of understanding for the product you work on.  
Only then it comes with a more mature product. Working with a passive attitude toward the product can cause to bring errors in the program.

When a planner is designing the ideal ones, the role of developers is to trim it between the reality and ideals because there are always gaps between reality and ideals. 
Therefore, during the development process,  developers should be active such as creating a prototype with the planner and so on. 
Rather than sticking to their opinions,  the attitude which acknowledges the differences of each other and tries to achieve consensus is necessary.

For example, even if others' opinion are different from yours, you'd better stick and hear them out when they are talking. 
After that, adding comments with your opinion to proceed for consensus would be a good attitude. 
It is very obvious to make a conflict if adhering to only your opinion, not listen to anybody.

I believe that meeting a halfway can cause for a good result and also derive enjoyment of collaboration.
