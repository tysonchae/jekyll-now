There are two way to make a comment.
Using /* */ and //.

Usually if you want to comment out multiple line, you tends to use /* */ and if you want to commnet out only one line, you would use // then.
We can use either /* */ or // in any situation and it's your preference. 

However, I prefer use // in any situation because you might have unhappy result from some condition.

ex in javascript : alert( "100 10 1".match(/\d0*/g) ); 

You will hava an error in this condition.
I recommend to use // in any situation.
