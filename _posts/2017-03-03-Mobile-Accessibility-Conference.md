Today I attended Mobile Accessibility Conference which Dr. Raman and Charles Chen presented.
Actually, this was small session that DR.Raman gathered attendees’ questions on accessibility first and gratified their curiosity by giving answers.
I don’t have much knowledge on Android but the accessibility is one of my concerns since I have done volunteering for the disabled.

There was a question on offering accessibility services no for those who are physical disabilities as well as visual impairments.
Tecla Project offers a button that controls all the functions. Therefore we can use all the features by pressing only a button.
This has been studied in UT(University of Toronto).

It was such a short time to discuss on a lot of topics attendees brought but swear that it was so good a time.
We talked on Webview, ChromeVox, Speech recognition, and etc.

I believe that once the disabled feels convenient with it, everyone feels the same way or more.

p.s: I have started working on Android now.
